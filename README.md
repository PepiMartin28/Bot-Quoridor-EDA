# Bot-Quoridor-EDA

Hi im Martin Pepi, im a student of Systems Engineer. 

This is the bot that i made for the Eventbrite Development Academy, i made it whit the dependecy 'ws' and for the testing i used the dependency 'jest'.

In the src there are 2 files, the app.js file is where all logic of the game is and in the another file is the connection with the socket.

I hope you enjoy using this bot.
